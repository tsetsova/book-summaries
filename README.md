# book-summaries

A collection of summaries of the technical books I've read. 

These are for my own educational purposes: writing these summaries helps me re-think the concepts in these books. They also are a great reference point for info I've read but may have forgotten. And finally they provide great conversation points with friends and colleagues. 

Hopefully if anyone finds these, it would inspire them to buy the books, because they're brilliant.
