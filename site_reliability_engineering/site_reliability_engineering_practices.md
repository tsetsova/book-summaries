# Site Reliability Engineering

## Practices 

> We can characterize the health of a service—in much the same way that Abraham Maslow categorized human needs [Mas43]—from the most basic requirements needed for a system to function as a service at all to the higher levels of function—permitting self-actualization and taking active control of the direction of the service rather than reactively fighting fires.

### Monitoring

> Without monitoring, you have no way to tell whether the service is even working; absent a thoughtfully designed monitoring infrastructure, you’re flying blind. 

### Incident Response

### Postmortem and Root-Cause Analysis

> We aim to be alerted on and manually solve only new and exciting problems presented by our service; it’s woefully boring to “fix” the same issue over and over. In fact, this mindset is one of the key differentiators between the SRE philosophy and some more traditional operations-focused environments.
